### Hi, my name is Jackson.

I'm currently a student at ODU's Game Studies & Design program, though I have experience with open source projects in the past. Though my contributions are long gone due to account inactivity, I was mostly involved in creating modules for the Foundry VTT Pathfinder 2e implementation. 

I'm currently working on a small, private blog about game design concepts and difficulties while juggling work, school, and personal duties.
